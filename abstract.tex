\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent 
In this thesis I describe my work in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment at the
International Space Station (ISS).  

In part I of this thesis, I perform a measurement of the electron flux with the electromagnetic calorimeter of AMS.

In part II of this thesis, I perform a energy control by using the geomagnetic cutoff.
