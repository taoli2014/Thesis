\section[Syst. uncertainties]{Systematic uncertainties in flux measurement}
The systematic uncertainties in the flux measurement include the uncertainties in the cut efficiency Data-MC correction as mentioned in ~\ref{sec:EpsiCorr}, the cutoff rigidity in ~\ref{sec:presel} and the unfolding procedure in ~\ref{sec:Unfold}. The total systematic uncertainties $\sigma_{syst}$ are calculated by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{syst}=\sqrt{\sigma_{sel}^2+\sigma_{cf}^2+\sigma_{unf}^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data-MC correction systematics}
The systematics in electron selection are combined in two levels: preselection level and  selection level. Similar to the procedures described in ~\ref{sec:EpsiCorr}, different control samples are studied.

\subsection{Rigidity of cutoff systematics}
The systematics in the $R_cf$ cut are studied by changing threshold of the safety factor.
